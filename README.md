# Password_Manager
- This is a fun **Python Project** Where we Store **Passwords** along with the **Username** and Account from which they are Accosiated With in an `Encrypted` Manner. 
- In This Project I have Used `cyptography` module to Convert normal text to an encrypted text. Example:- `username` and `password`.
- This Project is Inspired from [5 Python Mini Projects](https://youtu.be/DLn3jOsNRVE).
- I Have Followed This Tutorial from [Here](https://youtu.be/DLn3jOsNRVE?t=4193).
- **Disclamer**
  - The code in the Video or The Code Here are not Exactly Some However the Concepts are Exactly Same so You can use this video for Understanding Concepts.
  - Do not Use this code for Storing any of Your Important Passwords.
  - This Video is not Created by me.
