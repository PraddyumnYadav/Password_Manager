- This is a fun Python Project Where we Store Passwords along with the Username and Account from which they are Accosiated With in an Encrypted Manner. 
- In This Project I have Used `cyptography` module to Convert normal text to an encrypted text. Example:- `username` and `password`.
- This Project is Inspired from [5 Python Mini Projects](https://youtu.be/DLn3jOsNRVE).
- I Have Followed This Tutorial from [Here](https://youtu.be/DLn3jOsNRVE?t=4193).
